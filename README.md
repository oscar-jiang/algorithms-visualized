## 🖼️ Graph Editor

An interactive undirected graph editor built with JavaScript and D3.js.

- **Draw mode:** Click anywhere on the canvas to add nodes.
- **Delete mode:** Remove nodes or edges by clicking on them.
- **Link mode:** Connect nodes by selecting them sequentially to add edges.
- **Drag and drop:** Move nodes freely to reposition your graph visually.
- **Reset canvas:** Clear the entire graph and start fresh.

## 🎲 Graph Sequence Game

Test your understanding of graph degree sequences with an interactive game based on the Havel-Hakimi algorithm.

- **Create and manipulate graphs** by adding nodes and linking them with edges.
- **Move nodes** freely to organize your graph visually.
- **Multiple levels** ranging from beginner to advanced challenges to practice your skills.
- Use the **Havel-Hakimi Algorithm button** to automatically verify if a given degree sequence can form a simple undirected graph.
- Interactive controls and clear status indicators guide you through the gameplay.
- Learn how the algorithm works by experimenting with graph sequences.

## 🧮 Sorting Algorithm Visualization

Explore and interact with multiple sorting algorithms.

- Choose from popular sorting algorithms like **Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Selection Sort**.
- Generate random arrays of variable sizes (10 to 300 items) to sort.
- Adjust the playback speed to see the sorting process at your preferred pace.
- Visual feedback includes array elements displayed as bars with live updates during sorting.
- Intuitive controls for play, and generating new arrays.
- Responsive and clean UI powered by D3.js for smooth visualizations.

This tool healps users understand how sorting algorithms work internally by watching step-by-step movements and comprisons.
